### Personal profile 

I'm a software engineer driven by a great passion for designing and building software. I firmly believe in having strong theoretical knowledge as a mean and a requirement for taking complex design decisions but also in a need for a constant practice of programming in order to keep contact with the fast-paced changing world of software development. I'm not particularly in love with a specific programming language, though I tend to prefer statically and strong typed ones.

### Education

**M. Sc. in Computer Science Engineering**, Federico II University, Naples, IT

_Dissertation title: “Payload inspection techniques for internet traffic classification”_

Developed a plugin for a network traffic classification platform called [TIE](http://tie.comics.unina.it/). The plugin was based on [L7Filter](http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/), an open source project, and implemented a deep packet inspection technique based on regular expression matching to classify application level protocols analyzing TCP and UDP packets.
