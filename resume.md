### Personal profile 

I'm a creative software engineer driven by a great passion for designing and building great software. I firmly believe in having a strong theoretical framework as a mean for taking complex design decisions. I also constantly practice programming in order to keep contact with the fast-paced changing world of software development. I'm extremely versatile as I am language agnostic, though I tend to prefer statically and strongly typed ones.

### Experience

&bullet; __*Software engineer* at [**System Simulation**](http://ssl.co.uk), London, UK, May 2012 to present__
\- Developed and improved internal tooling for the company proprietary database system, Index+. Examples include optimizitation of the XML to Data Definition Language translation tool by 6x applying XML node caching, and a 10x improvement of the uniqe list validation moving from a brute force comparison algorithm to a hashtable search based one. I've also added support for TLS and SOCKS connection in the database network server code.

\- Main developer on the MuseumIndex+ Web Edition project, a port to the Web of the company flagship cataloguing software system. The system has a front end written in HTML5 + Javascript using the ExtJS 3.4 framework. The backend is written in a proprietary scripting language called IEXE.  

\- Implemented TWAIN support in AssetIndex+, a Digital Asset Management system, for ingesting images acquired from cameras and TWAIN-compatible devices (e.g. microscopes).

&bullet; __*Analist/Developer* at [**Cid Software Studio S.p.A.**](http://www.cidsoftware.it), Naples, IT, May 2009 to Jan 2012__
	\- Over three years I've worked with many different teams of different sizes, ranging from 2 to 10 people, on many projects including: 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\* a Document Management System written in J2EE/Hibernate for Local Government bodies where I
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implemented PDF report generation.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\* a ticketing system built as a customization of Alfresco, a Java Document Management System.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\* A web-based map visualization tool written in ExtJS and OpenLayers.


&bullet; __*Junior Software Engineer* at [**Think3 Inc.**](http://www.think3.eu), Bologna, IT, Feb 2009 to Mar 2009__
	\- I started a job to modularize the company flagship CAD software system, ThinkDesign, aided by an academic research tool called Bunch able to cluster modules minimizing dependencies between them. Bunch required a dependency graph as input that I obtained using a source code analisys tool with a C++ plugin that I wrote for this project.

&bullet; __*Indipendent Developer*, Oct 2005 to Jan 2007__
	\- I designed and developed a business desktop application in C# with the .NET Framework and a SQL database to support all the activities of a freight broker (customers, contracts, invoices, accountancy, reporting).

### Education

&bullet; **M. Sc. in Computer Science Engineering, 2009, Federico II University, Naples, IT**

_Dissertation title: “Payload inspection techniques for internet traffic classification”_

I developed a plugin for a network traffic classification platform called [TIE](http://tie.comics.unina.it/). The plugin was based on [L7Filter](http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/), an open source project, and implemented a deep packet inspection technique based on regular expression matching to classify application level protocols analyzing TCP and UDP packets.
